A programming language written in TypeScript, with two forms of syntax, one based on JavaScript/TypeScript and one based on Gen Z slang.

# GigaScript

There are two forms of this language, ***.g** and ***.gsx**. ***.g** files use traditional syntax similar to JavaScript/TypeScript. ***.gsx** files use the Gen Z slang syntax. GigaChads use ***.gsx** :).

The boring version of GigaScript...

## .gsx <img src="https://github.com/aName2050/GigaScript/blob/main/assets/GigaScript-X.png" />

The cool version of GigaScript!

This syntax is currently unavailable. I'm still working on it!

A programming language written in TypeScript, with two forms of syntax, one based on JavaScript/TypeScript and one based on Gen Z slang.

# GigaScript

There are two forms of this language, **\*.g** and **\*.gsx**. **\*.g** files use traditional syntax similar to JavaScript/TypeScript. **\*.gsx** files use the Gen Z slang syntax. GigaChads use **\*.gsx** :).

## Run GigaScript and GigaScript-X

You can learn how to run GigaScript and GigaScript-X on your machine [here](https://github.com/aName2050/GigaScript/wiki/Run-GigaScript-or-GigaScript%E2%80%90X).

## Add GigaScript to your PATH

### Bash / Unix-based Systems (Linux, MacOS)

1. Locate the **absolute** directory for the `gigascript` file, located in the `/.bin` directory. It should look something like `Z:\GigaScript\.bin\gigascript`.
2. Run the command `chmod +x PATH_TO_GIGASCRIPT_BIN`, replacing `PATH_TO_GIGASCRIPT_BIN` with the path you got from the previous step.
3. Next run the command `export PATH="PATH_TO_GIGASCRIPT_DIR:$PATH"`, replacing `PATH_TO_GIGASCRIPT_DIR` with the path you got from step 1, but without the `gigascript` file. The path should look something like `Z:\GigaScript\.bin`.

Remember to restart your terminal to apply the changes to your PATH

### Windows

1. Locate the **absolute** directory for the `.bin` directory, and copy it your clipboard. It should look something like `Z:\GigaScript\.bin`.
2. Press the `Windows` key on your keyboard.
3. Type in `path` and click on `Edit the system environment variables`.
4. In the dialog box that opens, click the `Environment Variables...` button near the bottom.
5. If you want **GigaScript** to be available for **all** users on your system, click on `Path` under the `System variables` section. If you want GigaScript only for yourself, click on `Path` under the `User variables for <user>` section.
6. Click on `Edit...` at the bottom of the section.
7. On the **right** side of the next dialog box, click on `New`.
8. Paste in the directory.
9. Click `OK` on all the dialog boxes.

Remember to restart your terminal to apply the changes to your PATH
